## 🧭 Curriculum Design Principles

- Progress from **foundations → systems → autonomy → production**
- Every week introduces **one new layer of complexity**
- Every topic must map to a **real-world system or business use case**
- Students should be employable as **AI / ML / LLM / Agentic AI Engineers** by the end
